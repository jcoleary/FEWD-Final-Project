		<!--<p>With an overall area of 30.3 million km<sup>2</sup> (11.7 million mi<sup>2</sup>) and a population of 1.1 billion people, Africa is the world's second largest continent by both area and population.  54 countries currently comprise Africa, inculding the world's youngest, South Sudan, which became a nation in 2011.  Most countries in Africa are descended from the infrastructures of nineteenth-century European colonization.  While Africa has demonstrated a considerable amount of rapid development since the 1950s, Africa still suffers from the legacies of colonization and exploitation.

<!--<p>Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but unusually dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. The boundaries of Asia are traditionally determined as that of Eurasia; the division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal, the Ural River, and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. </p>-->

<!--<p>The Australia-Pacific Region, also known as Oceania, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean.  Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. The term is often used more specifically to denote a continent comprising Australia and proximate islands or biogeographically as a synonym for either the Australasian ecozone (Wallacea and Australasia) or the Pacific ecozone (Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia, excluding both New Zealand and mainland New Guinea) </p>-->

<!--<p>Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europe—a concept dating back to classical antiquity—are arbitrary; the primarily physiographic term "continent" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current boundaries.</p>-->
<h3>Discrepancies:</h3>
</p>Cyprus is considered part of Europe on this website.  Turkey and Russia are counted twice as they exist in both Europe and Asia.  Turkey and Russia rank as some of the largest nations in Europe due to the fact that their major population centers are in what is considered "Europe."  Kosovo is recognized as an indepndent entity on this website.<p>
